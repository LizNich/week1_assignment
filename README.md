# week1_assignment

Reflection:

Requirements achieved:
A recognisable header which remains as you scroll down.
Visual appealing images and font style.
Images load correctly and display properly.
Text included for 3 pages (currently shown at the bottom of image 3).
Footer.

Requirements not achieved yet:
Navigation = The top bar is missing navigation. I added the <nav> to Home as a test but it changed the text to blue underlined.
Placing text over the images = The text that should appear on the 3 images to represent home, shop and exhibition pages is at the bottom below the last image.
Read More = I think the 'Read More' should be separate to the text? I've not achieved this, but in its place I added a "Here!" button with a shadow.

Further reflections:
I may be getting positioning, alignment and flexbox confused so I'll go back to the modules.
I think there is code in CSS that's not needed. This is probably due to using what I know worked earlier in week. I removed some by commenting out sections and seeing if it made a difference to the page.

I've approached the build one section at a time and adding into the sections as I go i.e. images then navigation bar, then text boxes. I think this might be why my page text is not working. It would be useful for me to understand structure best practice.

when I was stuck, I googled, asked Tim, asked the breakout room and returned to the code in the modules in GitHub (e.g. on positioning). I inspected the SpaceY web page a couple of times when I got stuck, but i didn't want to look at it too much to give me a chance to work out on my own.

Feedback welcome! I've left a few comments in the css tab.
